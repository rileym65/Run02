run02.rc:
  If run02.rc exists in the directory where Run/02 is run, it will
read this file and process options from the file.  The options in
in the file are the same as for command line switches.  In the run02.rc
file each option must exist on its own line.  The run02.rc file is
processed before command line switches, as such command line switches
can be used to override options set in the run02.rc file
